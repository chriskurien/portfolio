        <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>When I was considering what problem to chose for my interaction design coursework, I couldn't help but be drawn to a problem that affects over 44.7 million Americansâ€”student loan debt. As an issue that is so widespread in America, it is no surprise that student loans dominate our news cycle and presidential debates. While the main issue is with the amount of debt itself, there are other issues, like the lack of support throughout the repayment process, the highly decentralized nature of student loans, and the difficulty in tracking numerous loans that creates additional stress for people. For this project, I decided to create a solution that addresses the aforementioned issues. I also decided to focus on people who would be classified as aggressive payers, defined as people who try to finish payments within 1-5 years. Though this range could vary,  I want the user group to be people paying more than their minimum payments.</p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>To begin the process of identifying a feasible solution, I started by coming up with 8 unique potential solutions. To allow for maximum creativity, I considered solutions outside of the digital realm. After coming up with 8 unique ideas, I worked on creating a storyboard for each item to understand the context under which each would work. To get a clear vision of my target users and their goals, I created personas that I believe are representative of them. Their profiles were created based on online research and in-person interviews that I had with people. I also created an anti-persona so that I knew who this product was not for. 
          <br><br>The next step in my process was to create a story map to represent the steps a user might currently take to solve the problem of tracking their student loans and maintaining their motivation. This step allowed me to think more about what types of features I needed to add to my solution so that my users could easily adopt it into their day-to-day lives. After creating sketches, scenarios, and storyboards I settled on creating a mobile application. At this point, it was time to think of the features I would want on my application. I decided to use the QOC analysis method in order to map out features and how to design them into the application. I found this step helpful because it made think through all of the potential options.<br><br>After considering key features, I created a paper prototype of my work and created a video to mock the interactions I was considering including.  I used paper because it was easy to test ideas and to think through the logic of my application. The following video is my final paper prototype ( I had two iterations prior to creating this video)</p>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>I created my final prototype in AdobeXD because I found the interface clean and intuitive. My full prototype can be found here.</p>
