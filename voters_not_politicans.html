      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>In November 2018, Voters Not Politicians (VNP) succeeded in passing a constitutional amendment for a new redistricting process that will prevent partisan gerrymandering in Michigan.With the passage of this amendment, Michigan will create an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission (ICRC). Upon its creation, the ICRC will work on getting input from Communities of Interest across the state regarding where they think the lines should be drawn for their own electoral districts. Historically, states that have undergone redistricting processes primarily relied on public hearings to receive community input. During these hearings, people would provide oral accounts, text descriptions, maps, and other materials to help the committee get a better understanding of where to draw district lines. To make this process available to large groups of people who may not attend public hearings, VNP wanted our group to create a tool that would allow citizens to submit documentation to the committee online. VNP believed that this tool will also allow for information to be collected in a more standardized manner as they would like this tool to require citizens to submit maps and written statements of their communities of interest. Our team’s goal in this project was to identify what features would make such a tool effective, inclusive, and usable since the potential user base is anyone that is a resident of Michigan. We then used this information to create medium-fidelity wireframes of the portal.</p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>My contributions to this process were in conducting background research/literature reviews and usability testing. I also worked on moving our wireframes into a medium-fidelity level. Below I have outlined more specifically what each of these steps entailed.</p>

      <h3>Background Research/Literature Review</h3>
      <p>To better understand Communities of Interest and the role they play in the redistricting process, we decided it was important to research how other states work to translate community input into tangible election district lines.This research was carried out primarily by myself and one other team member. My teammate looked at Arizona’s process while I took a look at California’s process. We chose these states because they both utilized Independent Redistricting Committees like Michigan. I reviewed relevant literature available on the Internet, read transcripts from town hall meetings, and talked to a member of the California Commission in order to obtain information that would help inform our eventual prototype. Some of the key findings I got from this research were that:

        <ul>
          <li> Many people in California presented in another language during the public hearings and therefore had to use a translator. To create a tool that is inclusive of the diverse communities that exist in Michigan, translated materials must be available on the tool. </li>
          <li> Participants of public hearings ranged in age from 13-80. Considering that this tool will be used via laptops, computers, and potentially cellphones, additional training may need to be provided to help those who are not as adept at using information technology. This fact may also be important to consider when creating the visual design for the website. For example, the colors being used on the tool should meet the guidelines for older populations who may have higher occurrences of visual impairments. </li>
          <li> Submissions to the Commission can take different forms. By limiting the manner in which submissions can be made (e.g. requiring users to submit maps), important testimony can be lost. </li>
          <li>More than 2,700 speakers spoke at the public input hearings and presented testimony about their communities and regions. The Commission also received more than 2,000 written submissions containing testimony and maps as well as over 20,000 written comments, input, and suggestions from individuals and groups. As a result, there were times when the Commission became overwhelmed with information. The usage of an online tool presents an opportunity to collect a large amount of data; however, the Michigan Commission needs to be intentional in selecting the information they want to ask of citizens. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>

      <p>When our client initially proposed the project, she asked us to focus on creating a process that required users to draw a map around their community of interest. She also mentioned that their organization was most interested in using the Google Maps API. After conducting background research and user research, I suggested that we should see how users actually interact with mapping tools to see if this was a feasible feature for the portal. So, another teammate and I set out to do 10 guerilla-style testings of Google Maps and Districtr. During our test, we asked users to draw an enclosed shape around where their neighborhood lies by using both Districtr and Google Maps. Besides informing users that “there are tools which allow you to highlight or draw geographic spaces,” we provided minimal guidance during the tests. One of the major findings from our testing was that the majority of our users had difficulty using the tools without instruction. This fact was even more concerning considering that all of our users were under the age of 25, a cohort that typically feels the most comfortable using technology. </p>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>

      <p>After conducting all of our research, we worked together to create sketches using a whiteboard (See Below)​.</p>

      <p>After this process, I worked on moving our sketches into Balsamiq. During this process, I suggested that we create two different versions of our prototype, one that requires users to submit maps and another that gives users the option to submit a map. I thought that presenting both options to our client was important since our research showed that map drawing is not something many people feel comfortable with. We presented these two low-fidelity wireframes to our client, and after explaining our rationale, she agreed with us that the version that gave users the option of submitting a map was the better alternative.</p>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>

      <p>Our group presented our designs and findings at the School of Information's Design Exposition which is attended annually by professors, students, clients, and members of the Ann Arbor community. We also delivered a full report with all of our findings to our client. </p>
