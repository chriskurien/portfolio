  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>During my first semester at the University of Michigan, I took SI 501 - Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations, where I worked in a team to help a client address a real-world problem. The course placed an emphasis on using ethnographic and contextual research to address the different types of problems organizations face on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>

  Our client was a financial services company* that wanted our team to take a look at an HR program they have in place. This program is a two-year, entry-level rotational program within their different technology departments. As this rotational program is composed of recent college graduates, our client wanted to make sure the program has the proper infrastructure in place to provide their newly hired employees with the best possible experiences.

  <br><br>Our main goal in this project was to get an understanding of the experiences of current and former program participants in order to identify any potential areas of improvement.

  <h3>Findings</h3>
  <p>Our process uncovered 3 key findings. Three of the findings were related to areas of improvement while the last finding covered the components that participants enjoy about the program. The three key findings that informed our recommendations were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="bigNumbers">1.</span><p class="big">Standardization issues with several aspects of the program. This included the over-standardization of some processes like employee evaluation and a lack of standardization in others like rotation placements. These issues resulted in feelings of frustration from employees, which affected their overall impression of the program.</p></li>
    <li><span class="bigNumbers">2.</span><p class="big">A lack of efficiency with some processes which resulted in lost time and opportunity.</p></li>
    <li><span class="bigNumbers">3.</span><p class="big">The lack of program structure. From our findings, it appears that the main structure of the program is having rotations; however, participants would like to see different activities built-in to provide a more engaging experience.</p></li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <p>After identifying the key areas of improvement our group worked to find solutions that we believed would be easy for our client to implement. Some of our solutions are listed below: ​</p>

  <h4>Standardization</h4>
  <p>Currently, there is a lack of standardization when it comes to providing participants with training for each rotation, which makes them feel as if they are on their own. To help with this process, we recommended that any department receiving a participant should be required to submit documentation to the program coordinator about what the participant's first day, week, and month will look like with regard to training and orientation. The coordinator can then determine whether more structure needs to be added.​</p>

  <h4>Efficiency</h4>
  <p>Each month, participants of the program have a group meeting with the program coordinator. However, most of the participants we interviewed felt that these meetings were a waste of time because the agenda was rarely followed and much of the content could be shared via email. To fix this, we believe it will be helpful to create more dynamic meeting content. One suggestion was to bring in senior members of the organization to these meetings so that participants have the opportunity to network and learn more about the organization they work at. </p>

  <h4>Program Struture</h4>
    <p>It was interesting to see how the program coordinator refers to an incoming class as a cohort; however, the participants themselves do not identify with the word cohort because they believe they do not interact enough with each other to feel comfortable using that term. This could be remediated by creating cohort-specific bonding activities. We suggested activities like ropes courses or escape rooms, as there are studies that show that these types of activities encourage cooperation, goodwill, and team familiarity.</p>
