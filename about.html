          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Picture of Chris Kurien">
          <p> For most of my life, I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I decided to try anything and everything. I ranged from thinking I would work as a forensic accountant for the FBI (shoutout to my undergraduate Accounting & Business Technology majors and internship at the SEC) to wanting to work as a social worker for CPS (I was heavily involved in different service organizations on campus).​ Though these paths and experiences did not work out, they all had one thing in common: elements of UX. My undergraduate majors focused heavily on collaborative thought, strategic thinking, research, data analysis, and project management. Additionally, my social justice/community engagement extracurricular activities helped me further develop my interpersonal, leadership, and design skills. <br><br>

          One day, when I spent way too much time considering what features to include in a new website I was designing for a club, I realized that I truly enjoyed understanding a user’s experience. From there, I found that there was an entire field dedicated to just that. Before finding UX, I was frustrated with my diverse experiences, wondering how I would meld them all together to be successful in one field. But now, I am grateful for them because they prepared me with the skills that I need to be successful. <br><br>

          I am currently a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on UX Research. Having finally found something I am passionate about, I am very excited to see what the future holds. </p>
