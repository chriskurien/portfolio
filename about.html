    <div id="bio">
      	<p>For most of my life, I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I decided to try anything and everything. I ranged from thinking I would work as a forensic accountant for the FBI (shoutout to my undergraduate Accounting & Business Technology majors and internship at the SEC) to wanting to work as a social worker for CPS (I was heavily involved in different service organizations on campus).​ Though these paths and experiences did not work out, they all had one thing in common: elements of UX. My undergraduate majors focused heavily on collaborative thought, strategic thinking, research, data analysis, and project management. Additionally, my social justice/community engagement extracurricular activities helped me further develop my interpersonal, leadership, and design skills. One day, when I spent way too much time considering what features to include in a new website I was designing for a club, I realized that I truly enjoyed understanding a user’s experience. From there, I found that there was an entire field dedicated to just that. Before finding UX, I was frustrated with my diverse experiences, wondering how I would meld them all together to be successful in one field. But now, I am grateful for them because they prepared me with the skills that I need to be successful. I am currently a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on UX Research. Having finally found something I am passionate about, I am very excited to see what the future holds.</p>

      	<h2>When I'm Not Working, I Love: </h2>
      	
      	<h3>Learning New Art Forms</h3>
      	<p>I love learning new things and art has always been something that I've been drawn to. To date, I've taught myself embroidery, sewing, ceramics (I did take a class in this), jewelry making, and fluid art. My current obsessions are hand-lettering (because it gives me an excuse to write as many cheesy quotes as my heart desires) and creating digital pieces using Procreate, Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>


      	<h3>Taking Boomerangs</h3>
      	<p>I may be one of the only people out there that still uses this app but I love capturing moments that we sometimes miss.</p>


      	<h3>Working on Social Justice/Community Engagement Projects</h3>
      	<p>I love getting involved in my local community. During my time at the University of Miami, I got the opportunity to learn more about various social issues and was able to work with different organizations from around the country. Some of my favorite experiences were:

      	<ul>
      		<li> Creating a poster campaign on campus to raise awareness about relationship violence. </li>
      		<li> Teaching different groups of students, administrators, and staff members how to create different pieces of artwork as a way to fundraise for Nicklaus Children's Hospital (think Painting with a Twist). The biggest group I taught was 60 people! </li>
      		<li> Serving as Program Chair for Tunnel of Oppression, a sensory-based, museum-style program designed to expose participants to various acts of oppression taking place today.</li>
      	</ul>
      	</p>


      	<h3>Finding New TV Shows</h3>
      	<p>In an alternative universe, I'm most definitely a TV show critic. My favorite shows include Orphan Black, Travelers, Veep, Arrested Development (Seasons 1-3), and Ugly Betty.</p>
